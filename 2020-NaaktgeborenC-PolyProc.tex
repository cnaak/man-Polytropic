\section{Introduction}

    Many equilibrium engineering thermodynamics processes  are  taken  to  follow  a  polytropic
    relationship  of  constant  $Pv^n$---in  which  $P$  is  the  system  pressure,  usually  in
    \kilo\pascal, $v$ is the system specific volume, usually  in  $\meter\cubed\!\per\kilogram$,
    and $n$ is the dimensionless polytropic  exponent~\cite{2013-CengelYA+BolesMA-AMGH}---which,
    for a ``1--2'' process, with initial and final end states labeled as ``1''  and  ``2'',  can
    also be written in terms of end states properties, as $P_1v_1^n = P_2v_2^n$.

    Some maintream thermodynamics textbooks introduce polytropic processes  in  the  context  of
    closed system boundary work, as a $P\!:\!P(v)$ relationship to plug  in  the  boundary  work
    integral,   which    contains    a    $P\,dv$    integrand~\cite{2013-CengelYA+BolesMA-AMGH,
    2002-MoranMJ+ShapiroHN-LTC, 1985-WylenG-Wiley}. In such texts, the  polytropic  relationship
    is frequently said to find support in measurents, while no specific  theoretical  derivation
    is presented at the point of introduction.

    On  the  other  hand,  other  texts~\cite{1986-JonesJB+HawkinsGA-Wiley,   2006-BejanA-Wiley,
    2015-KroosKA+PotterMC-Cengage} include derivations that lead to a polytropic process, or  at
    least to an isentropic version of it, in which the exponent $n$ has a determined value.

    Moreover, Bejan~\cite[p.~175]{2006-BejanA-Wiley} indicates that a constant  $Pv^n$  relation
    only holds \emph{locally} if the process is such that $n$ is a function of either $P$,  $v$,
    or both.

    A paper due to Christians~\cite{2012-ChristiansJ-IntJMechEngEduc} discusses the topic from a
    perspective  of  teaching  polytropic  processes  themselves,  placing   emphasis   on   the
    \emph{heat-to-work transfer ratio}---named by that author as ``energy transfer ratio''---and
    how its constancy not only yields, but constitutes a  pre-requisite  for  a  process  to  be
    polytropic, besides, naturally, the constancy of the caloric properties of the working  pure
    substance.

    This work proposes and develops the concepts of \emph{exact  polytropic}  and  \emph{locally
    polytropic} processes, and presents theory-derived \emph{requisites} for  a  process  to  be
    exactly polytropic. Moreover, an \emph{etymological} discussion is presented  in  connection
    to  the  usefulness  of  locally  polytropic  processes  as  discrete  building  blocks  for
    generalized equilibrium engineering thermodynamics process \emph{modeling}.

\section{Exact and Locally Polytropic Processes}

    %---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \subsection{Logical Processes}

    In equilibrium engineering thermodynamics, a \emph{process}---more properly  a  quasi-static
    or quasi-equilibrium one---is defined in terms of changes from a certain  equilibrium  state
    of a system to another~\cite{2013-CengelYA+BolesMA-AMGH}, with process \emph{path} being the
    (infinite) sequence of (quasi-)equilibrium states visited by the system during the  process.
    A process can be referred to by its path, with implicit or explicit end states.

    It is worth noting that no constraints are stated for the end states of  a  process  in  its
    definition.  This  allows  for  the  needed  flexibility  in  describing  the   variety   of
    transformations systems and control volumes can undergo in engineering thermodynamics.

    This lack of end state constraints in the definition of a process allows them to be splitted
    into multiple, successive `sub-processes' that still fit the definition  of  a  process,  as
    well as merged multiple successive ones together into `super-processes' that  also  fit  the
    definition of a process. This ability is extremely useful in grouping and splitting  systems
    and control volumes along with their underlying processes---a commom practice in engineering
    thermodynamics.

    Conversely, in order to  make  the  intended  distinction  between  proposed  ``exact''  and
    ``locally'' polytropic processes, additional constraints need to  be  made  to  process  end
    states. Thus, the following defines a  \emph{logical  thermodynamic  process},  which  is  a
    thermodynamic process with constrained end  states.  In  context,  i.e.,  in  thermodynamics
    texts, what's defined next can be simply called a ``logical process'':

    \begin{definition}[logical process]\label{def:logical.proc}
        A logical process is one in which its stated defining conditions, that determines all of
        the allowed interactions or property relations for  the  underlying  system  or  control
        volume, uniformly and continually apply to the  entirety  of  its  path  from---but  not
        earlier than---its initial state until---but not later than---its end state.
    \end{definition}

    Therefore,  for  a  simple  compressible  system---one  admitting   only   work   and   heat
    interactions---either stated heat and work interactions, or system property  specifications,
    or combinations of the two, define possible logical processes.

    Moreover, the stated defining conditions of a logical process can also carry  a  ``logical''
    qualifier, as to make it explicit they're being used in the definition of a logical process,
    as  in  the  ``logical  conditions,''  or  ``defining  logical   conditions''   expressions.
    Furthermore, the conditions themselves can carry the ``logical''  qualifier,  for  the  same
    purpose.

    \begin{example}\label{ex:ideal.Diesel}
        The   well-known   air-standard   ideal   Diesel    power    cycle,    illustrated    on
        Figure~\ref{fig:cycle.Diesel}, with ``intake'' state (of lowest temperature and pressure
        and maximum specific volume) labeled as ``1'', can be divided in  different  ways  using
        only logical processes. One such division is:  (i)~``logical  isentropic  compression'',
        ($\Delta s\!=\!0 \therefore Q\!=\!0$, $W\!\!<\!0$), (ii)~``logical  isobaric  heating'',
        ($Q\!>\!0$,  $\Delta  P\!=\!0   \therefore   W\!\!>\!0$),   (iii)~``logical   isentropic
        expansion'', ($\Delta s\!=\!0  \therefore  Q\!=\!0$,  $W\!\!>\!0$),  and  (iv)~``logical
        isochoric  cooling'',  ($Q\!<\!0$,  $\Delta  v\!=\!0   \therefore   W\!\!=\!0$),   which
        correspond, respectively, to the ``1--2'', ``2--3'', ``3--4'', and  ``4--1''  processes,
        i.e., to the canonical  processes  for  this  cycle,  excluding  sub-processes  thereof.
        Another possible division is: (a)~``logical isentropic compression'',  ($\Delta  s\!=\!0
        \therefore   Q\!=\!0$,   $W\!\!<\!0$),   (b)~``logical   no-heat-removal    expansion'',
        ($Q\!\geqslant\!0$, $W\!\!>\!0$), and  (c)~``logical  isochoric  cooling'',  ($Q\!<\!0$,
        $\Delta v\!=\!0 \therefore W\!\!=\!0$), which correspond, respectively, to the ``1--2'',
        ``2--4'' (through ``3''), and ``4--1'' processes, excluding sub-processes thereof, since
        these encompass the farthermost end states that uniformly and  continually  embrace  the
        stated defining logical conditions (a), (b), and (c).
    \end{example}

    \subsection{Exact Polytropic Processes}

    One is now in a position to define \emph{exact polytropic processes}:

    \begin{definition}[exact polytropic process]\label{def:exact.poly.proc}
        An exact polytropic process is a  logical  process  in  which  either  (i)~a  polytropic
        relation $Pv^n = \mbox{const.}$, with a  unique  polytropic  exponent  $n$,  or  (ii)~an
        isochoric logical condition, can be its sole logical defining condition,  provided  that
        no state in its path is visited more than once or serves simultaneously as  initial  and
        final end states in a given execution.
    \end{definition}

    It is worth noting that isochoric processes are equivalent to polytropic processes  with  $n
    \to \pm\infty$ between stated end states. Definition~\ref{def:exact.poly.proc} accounts  for
    the isochoric process non-unique polytropic exponent by explicitly including it as  a  valid
    exact polytropic process.

    \begin{lemma}\label{lemm:no.reversal}
        Any logical process defined by a single polytropic relation  with  a  unique  polytropic
        exponent, with non-identical end states can only be an exact polytropic process  in  the
        absence of reversals in its path.
    \end{lemma}

    \begin{proof}
        Let a logical process $\mathcal{P}_{1,2}$ be defined by  a  single  polytropic  relation
        with a unique polytropic exponent $n$, with non-identical end states ``$1$'' and ``$2$''
        that contains a set of reversal  states  ``$r_i$'',  with  $\{  i  \in  \mathbb{Z}  |  i
        \geqslant 1 \}$ in its path.

        Without loss of generality, let further $P_{r_1}  <  P_1$,  if  $n  \neq  0$,  i.e.,  an
        initially pressure-decreasing process---since the following argument  can  be  otherwise
        flipped, or laid out in $v$, for finite $n$:

        Let state ``$\epsilon$'', defined as $(P_{\epsilon}, v_{\epsilon})$, belong to the  path
        of   a   sub-process   $\mathcal{P}_{1,r_1}$   of   the   original    logical    process
        $\mathcal{P}_{1,2}$, so that
        %
        \begin{equation}
            P_{\epsilon} - P_{r_1} = \Delta P \to 0.
            \label{eq:proof.Delta.P.epsi}
        \end{equation}
        %
        Since $\mbox{``}\epsilon\mbox{''} \in  \mathcal{P}_{1,r_1}  \in  \mathcal{P}_{1,2}$,  it
        follows from the definition of $\mathcal{P}_{1,2}$:
        %
        \begin{equation}
            P_{\epsilon}v_{\epsilon}^n = P_1v_1^n = P_{r_1}v_{r_1}^n.
            \label{eq:proof.Process.epsi}
        \end{equation}
        %
        Since at ``$r_1$'', the process experiments a reversal, thus proceeding with  increasing
        pressures. Let state ``$\zeta$'', defined as $(P_{\zeta},  v_{\zeta})$,  belong  to  the
        path  of  a  sub-process  $\mathcal{P}_{r_1,2}$  of   the   original   logical   process
        $\mathcal{P}_{1,2}$, so that
        %
        \begin{equation}
            P_{\zeta} \equiv P_{\epsilon} = \lim_{\Delta P \to 0} P_{r_1} + \Delta P,
            \label{eq:proof.P.zeta}
        \end{equation}
        %
        \noindent  so  that  process  $\mathcal{P}_{r_1,2}$  is  guaranteed  to  contain   state
        ``$\zeta$'', since state ``$r_1$'' is a  reversal  one,  rather  than  a  stopping  one,
        therefore:  $\mbox{``}\zeta\mbox{''}  \in  \mathcal{P}_{r_1,2}  \in  \mathcal{P}_{1,2}$,
        implying:
        %
        \begin{align}
            P_{\zeta}v_{\zeta}^n & = P_{r_1}v_{r_1}^n = P_{\epsilon}v_{\epsilon}^n\quad\mbox{(by
            Eq.~(\ref{eq:proof.Process.epsi}))}\quad\rightharpoondown
            \label{eq:proof.Process.zeta} \\
            P_{\epsilon}v_{\zeta}^n & = P_{\epsilon}v_{\epsilon}^n \quad\rightharpoondown \\
            v_{\zeta}^n & = v_{\epsilon}^n \quad\rightharpoondown \\
            v_{\zeta} & = v_{\epsilon}.
            \label{eq:proof.vzeta=vepsi}
        \end{align}
        %
        From  Eqs.~(\ref{eq:proof.P.zeta})  and~(\ref{eq:proof.vzeta=vepsi}),  one  has   states
        ``$\epsilon$''  and  ``$\zeta$''  are  identical:   $\mbox{``}\epsilon\mbox{''}   \equiv
        \mbox{``}\zeta\mbox{''}$, with $\mbox{``}\epsilon\mbox{''}  \in  \mathcal{P}_{1,2}$  and
        $\mbox{``}\zeta\mbox{''} \in \mathcal{P}_{1,2}$.

        Therefore,      by      the       exact       polytropic       process       definition,
        Definition~\ref{def:exact.poly.proc}, logical process $\mathcal{P}_{1,2}$ cannot  be  an
        exact   polytropic   process,   since   there   is   at    least    one    state---state
        ``$\epsilon$''---that is visited more than once in a given execution.
    \end{proof}

    \noindent\textit{Remarks:\/}~given that the polytropic  exponent  is  unique,  any  reversal
    would cause the underlying system or control volume to re-visit states already covered, thus
    violating the exact polytropic process definition.

    \begin{theorem}[Cycle]\label{theo:cycle}
        No cycle is an exact polytropic process.
    \end{theorem}

    \begin{proof}
        The defining feature of a cycle of same end states directly violates the restriction  of
        no same initial and end states.
    \end{proof}

    \noindent\textit{Remarks:\/}~even if a cycle can be collapsed down as  to  be  described  in
    terms of a single polytropic process, such as an ideal Diesel cycle with fuel cut ratio $r_c
    \equiv v_3 / v_2 = 1$, the fact that  such  a  cycle  must  invariably  make  at  least  one
    reversal, as to cycle back to previous states, Lemma~\ref{lemm:no.reversal} would constitute
    a second reason to disqualify the cycle as a (single) exact polytropic process.

    For an exact polytropic process, one has, between its end states extrema:%
    %
    \begin{align}
        Pv^n & = c_1 = \text{const.}        & \rightharpoondown\\
        \log(Pv^n) & = \log(c_1) \equiv c_2 & \rightharpoondown\\
        \log P + n\log v & = c_2            & \rightharpoondown\\
        \log P & = -n\log v + c_2. \label{eq:affine}
    \end{align}
    %
    Equation~(\ref{eq:affine}) is an affine relationship between $\log P$ and $\log v$---a  line
    segment that links the process end states extrema---in which  the  polytropic  exponent  $n$
    figures as the negative of the line segment slope.

    Figure~\ref{fig:cycle.Diesel} is drawn in $\log P \times \log v$  coordinates,  and  depicts
    one line segment between each  adjacent  labeled  state  pairs  ``$1$--$2$'',  ``$2$--$3$'',
    ``$3$--$4$'', and ``$4$--$1$'', in which  all  labeled  states  are  extrema  of  each  line
    segment,  and  there  are  no  reversals.  Therefore,  all  such  processes,  enumerated  on
    Example~\ref{ex:ideal.Diesel} with roman numerals (i)--(iv), are exact polytropic ones.

    %---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \subsection{Locally Polytropic Processes}

    Figure~\ref{fig:non.exact} illustrates a process that plots as a curved segment in  $\log  P
    \times \log v$ coordinates. Basic derivative knowledge allows us to think of such process as
    one with a continuously variable slope in double logarithmic $P\times v$ coordinates.

    \begin{figure}[ht]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=40mm]{fig/nonExactPolytropic.pdf}
        \caption{A process displaying a curve in logarithmic $P\times v$ coordinates.}
        \label{fig:non.exact}
    \end{figure}

    Attempting to \emph{exactly} represent the process as a set of straight line segments  would
    result in an infinite set of segments of vanishing  length---hence,  same  end  states.  The
    definition of exact polytropic processes forbids any process in such a set to  be  an  exact
    polytropic one, so that \emph{nowhere} along such a process one finds  an  exact  polytropic
    process.

    If, however, one allows for approximation, as is commom practice in engineering, the  curved
    process can be represented by an increasing but  finite  amount  of  line  segments  with  a
    decreasing amount of deviation (error). The beginning of such a process, in which the amount
    of line segments is doubled at each step, is depicted, with a shift in $v$ for the  sake  of
    improved visualization, on Figure~\ref{fig:approx}.

    \begin{figure}[ht]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=40mm]{fig/approximations.pdf}
        \caption{Successive approximations to the curved process, in dark blue  solid  line,  by
            means of 2, 4, and 8 line segment sub-processes, in  dark  yellow  solid  lines,  in
            double  logarithmic  $P\times  v$   coordinates   (shifted   in   $v$   for   easier
            visualization)}
        \label{fig:approx}
    \end{figure}
